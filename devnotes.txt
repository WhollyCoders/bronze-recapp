I decided to build this application because I wanted a quicker 
way to COMPUTE the RESULTS for the weight loss COMPETITION.

Every WEEK the PARTICIPANT weighs in for accountability
The weights are recorded for the purpose of finding out if the
participant has lost weight or not.

In addition to computing the weight loss for the week, other 
computations are:

    weight loss percentage (week)
    weight loss (overall)
    weight loss percentage (overall)


To add to the level of accountability, the participants are 
placed on TEAMS.

In addition to computing individual weight loss data, the teams
weight loss data is also computed:

    team weight loss (week)
    team weight loss percentage (week)
    team weight loss (overall)
    team weight loss percentage (overall)
